<p style="font-size: larger">This website is a portfolio about me, which showcases what my likes are and what I am certified in. My name is Sarthak Barde (Sarth), and I am high school senior. I am planning to major in Computer Science/Engineering after my senior year. In my school, I am in Black Falcons (Cybersecurity), National Math Honor Society, National Technical Honor Society, Student Ambassadors and Rise Against Hunger clubs. In my free time, I read books, volunteer at different places, learn new coding languages, watch TV shows and movies, and go out. I have learnt Java, Python, Java Script and SQL programming languages. I have volunteered with Cary Teen Council at Herbert's Haunted House, Bond Park Boathouse, Carpenter Elementary School for beautifying gardens, etc.</p>
